I need know
somehow

Come back! [come back, come back, come back...]
I want come back
Where's the wise
Show me way

Always!
When you're here
Why [why, why, why...]
Do you steals a part of me?

Go! [go,go,go...]
Let's go out of here
Nothing else 
will be how before

I could
Hear you ask help
explanation about this hell

Nobody would this
You wouldn't never understand

I can
see you between chains
Of your mind again

You're a prisoner
Into yourself

Yourself!


Solo


Where
Where are you?
My dream is only way
arrive reach you

But crazy.
It's a little place
I'm lost in my mind
and I can't awake

Give me
Give me a little time
Yeah
Show me way

Can you hear me?
Can you show me?
Give me
Show me way


I could
Hear you ask help
explanation about this hell

Nobody would this
You wouldn't never understand

I can
see you between chains
Of your mind again

You're a prisoner
Into yourself

Yourself!
