THE BEGIN OF DREAM

intr. 
Deep, very deep
can you listen the sound?
I lose my mind
when I'd fallen down

Again, why? Again
All the times seem to repeat 
Who I am? Who I should be?
In this crazy world I'm myself

Maybe it's a different dream
But today I'm couldn't sleep
What is real? what is fantasy?
Somebody will me understand. One day

What do you thinks about people 
and about thinks the love
No, nobody understand
What I know is only mine. Is mine

intr.

Yeah,  I see you
isn't can to be only a dream
Many things I don't understand
But I know that I feel

Why did you seek me?
Why not other people?
Tell me what is this
Tell me what I do
 
Yeah, I see you
In the other side on the garden
Stop the time, I need for
Tell me what the happens

Can you look it's in my heart?
Can you look it's in my soul?
No, you don't feel me
and the voices call me now

Where I am?
You know about something
What do you want to me?
Give me or leave me

Yeah, I see you
it's real I know yep
Nobody understand
But, why has to be I?

Go! Release my hands
Leave me now, I want
The time is passing fast
I haven't more time. Good Bye!

Good
Bye!

Good
Bye!
