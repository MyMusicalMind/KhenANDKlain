Die Traumdeutung 

[verse]
Hey you!
What do you do,
in this place,
on the morning?

Hey you!
Why do you ask,
about things,
just so obvious?

(time...)

[bis]
Come on. 
The show has just begun
And you're late!

(late, late, late..)

Come on.
Follow me until yonder place
I show for you



[verse]
Hey you!
That are you afraid,
or distrust?
Is me?!

Hey You!
Do you trust me?
That's absurd! 
But I'm you!


[bis]
Come on. 
I need show you something
Into soul yours

Come on.
Here we are all equals
I show for you

(for you, for you..)
